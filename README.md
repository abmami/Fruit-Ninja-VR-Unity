# vr-fruit-ninja

## Description

This project was developed in the context of the course of XR at ESPRIT School of Engineering. The goal was to create a VR game using Unity and the XR Plugin. The game had to be able to run on the Meta Quest 2.
This game is a VR mini-version of the popular game Fruit Ninja. In this game the player will have to slice the fruits that get thrown at him by three turrets. The player will have to slice the fruits by using a sword. The player will have to avoid slicing the bombs that appear, because if he does he will lose a life. The game ends when the player loses all his lives. This game was developed using the XR Interaction Toolkit, which is the new framework for developing VR games in Unity. This framework allows us to easily develop VR games that can run on a wide range of VR devices. The game is very simple and it is not very polished, but it was a good way to learn how to use the XR Interaction Toolkit in the frame of an academic project.
